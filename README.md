# FPS-multiplayer-project

This was my first unity project I ever did around the end of 2020, the goal was to learn Unity basics but also ended up dabbling in some backend and IOT, player stats would be posted to the DB and shown in the player leaderboards, I also created a webgl spectator where users could spectate live matches from a browser which also displayed player stats currently the domain isn't active. If your interested in trying out the game, its in the build folder. The multiplayer still works but there will just be no one for you to player with :(

I am in a the process of making another FPS Multiplayer with the skills and techniques I've picked up over the past year.

## Main Menu (I was really bad at UI at the time)

I did also end up making an android mobile version along with a VR version but they are the most unstable version of the game
